# HOW TO RUN: Automate Preprocessing and Training using Prefect
---

SETUP

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Prefect Server (for dashboard & logs):

prefect server start

This launches the **Prefect UI** at → [http://127.0.0.1:4200](http://127.0.0.1:4200)
Keep this terminal open — it must keep running in the background.

In a NEW TERMINAL, activate your virtual environment and proceed with the next steps.

## OPTION 1: Wine Quality Dataset (Custom)

Verify the CSV path in `automate_prefect.py`:

FILEPATH/WineQT.csv

Run the pipeline:

python automate_prefect.py

Outputs:
Prefect logs showing each task (`load_data`, `normalize_data`, `train_model`, `evaluate_model`)
Model accuracy printed in the terminal
Real-time visualization of the flow in the Prefect UI ([http://127.0.0.1:4200](http://127.0.0.1:4200))

## OPTION 2: Toy Iris Dataset (no file needed)

Run:

python automate_prefect_toy.py

Outputs:
All Prefect tasks executed automatically
Accuracy displayed in the terminal
Optional logs and task progress visible in the dashboard

## WHAT YOU SEE IN PREFECT UI

* Flow name (e.g., `WineQuality_Pipeline` or `Iris_Pipeline`)
* Task boxes for each step (Load → Normalize → Train → Evaluate)
* Real-time execution status (Success / Failure)
* Task logs, duration, and outputs

## **DONE!**

You’ve successfully automated ML preprocessing and training pipelines using **Prefect** — now with a persistent dashboard for real-time tracking and monitoring. 🚀
