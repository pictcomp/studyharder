# HOW TO RUN: Register and Manage Trained Models using MLflow Model Registry

Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the MLflow tracking and model registry server:
   (Run this in a new terminal and keep it open)

   mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root ./mlruns --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000

   This starts the MLflow UI and Model Registry locally.

Run the training and registration script: (Custom or Toy)
   python register_model_mlflow.py

Open MLflow in your browser:
   http://127.0.0.1:5000

   Navigate to:
   - **Experiments tab** → See logged model and metrics
   - **Models tab** → See “MyModelRegistry” with its registered versions

Done! You’ve successfully registered a trained model in MLflow Model Registry.

Tip:
Each time you rerun the script, a new **version** of the model will appear in the Model Registry.
